Project Description
This project is a Fitness Booking System built using Next.js and MongoDB. The system allows users (trainees) to view available fitness trainers and their respective courses, book training sessions at specific time slots, and manage their bookings. Trainers have different areas of expertise, and each trainerâ€™s schedule is independently managed. Bookings are stored in MongoDB to ensure persistence, meaning users can exit or refresh the page and still see their bookings.

Features
View Trainers and Courses: A homepage displaying a list of trainers and their expertise as well as available courses.
Search Functionality: Users can search trainers or courses by name.
Trainer-Specific Booking: Users can select a trainer and book a training session from available time slots.
Persistent Bookings: Bookings are saved in MongoDB, so even if the page is refreshed or exited, booked time slots remain unavailable until canceled.
Real-time Booking Management: Users can view, confirm, and cancel bookings in real-time, with availability status updates.
Technologies Used
Frontend: Next.js (React framework)
Backend: Next.js API Routes
Database: MongoDB (No Mongoose)
CSS Styling: Custom CSS and react-calendar for date and time slot selection.
